About Me
</div>

<p>
<span class="homepage-bold"> Hi! </span>  My name is Sriram Venkatesh and I love making websites!
</p>

<p>
I am a 21 year old guy, living in Windy Wellington, New Zealand.  I have been making websites ever since I was 10.
</p>

<p>
 I have practical knowledge in JavaScript, Ruby on Rails and PHP. I am currently studying towards my Network Engineering Degree at Victoria University. I am also equipped with paid experience in test automation and deployment pipelines with a TDD and BDD focus. 
</p>

<p>
In my spare time, I am either: tinkering with my Raspberry Pi,  playing indoor cricket with my friends or participating in Indian Cultural Events.
