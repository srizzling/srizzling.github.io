It has been a two weeks and I am "starting" to understand Behat. 

For those of you who don't know what it is. It is a testing framework that tests behavour from the outside in (say what?!?). The framework is supposed to "support" (not replace) your unit tests and gives a method for validating from the user perspective. 

Because, it is human readable it gives buisness users the ability to be able to understand end result of a certain feature.

**Challenges**

After playing around with Behat one of the major challeneges I am finding adopting to it is the "Redundancy". There is actully very limted "Gherkin" reuse capability. What I mean by this is that there is a constant war between writing fully free form and writing within step definations.
